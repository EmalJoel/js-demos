# Javascript Demos!
I am learning Javascript and typescript and wanted a place to upload completed tutorials and projects.  I'm following guided instructional videos from youtube at this point but hopfully I'll eventually be building my own projects that can also go here.    

## John Smilga Demos
The first set of completed demo's are from John Smilga's video series that I found from freecodecamp.com.  His website is listed here https://www.johnsmilga.com/.   So far I have found them to be very informative.  Im sure I'll eventually get through all of his tutorials and then move on to someone else.  When that happens I'll make sure to document it.  

## My Progress
I have been working on Javascript/typescript for a while now.  I have almost finished "Beginning Javascript: The ultimate guide to modern Javascript" by Russ Ferguson and have also done a boatload of structured courses on udemy and skillshare as well.   At this point I feel like I need to work on projects to improve my skills.   When concepts are presented to me they make perfect sense however its trying to recall those concepts at a later date to implement them is the issue.   So the solution to that is practice and persistance.  Hence why I am doing this in the first place.   

## Code integrity
I don't know if this is a thing or concept at all as alot of code is borrowed from another source and then used to meet a specific need.   Anyway...for me its important to document where stuff comes from.  If I wrote something on my own then I will clarify that or if its from a guided tutorial that will also be referenced.  Its important to me that the original source is referenced.
